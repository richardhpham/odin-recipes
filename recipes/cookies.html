        <p>

            are made to fill that need, containing layers of egg, cheese,
            and sausage.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>1/2 finely minced white onion</li>
            <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>3 medium eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large 
                baking sheet with parchment paper</li>
            <li>Heat a non stick skillet over medium heat and cook sausage until 
                crumbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Add in the onion and cook, stirring and 
                breaking up the sausage until it is no longer pink. Transfer 
                mixture to a paper towel-lined plate and drain for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, Parmesan 
                cheese, and parsley in a large bowl; whisking until well 
                combined. Whisk in eggs until well combined. Add 3/4 cup Cheddar 
                cheese and stir until mixed in. Spoon in sausage mixture and mix 
                to form a thick batter.</li>
            <li>Scoop out about a 1/4 cup of the mixture and drop onto the 
                prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each 'cookie' with Cheddar cheese 
                and slightly flatten with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 10 minutes. If 
                cookie is still a little soft, cook for 2 minutes longer. Remove
                 from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
